# Image Pre-Processing for Freshness Classification of Fruits and Vegetables

In this project, we address the critical issue of food waste due to unclear expiration labels by enhancing the classification accuracy of fruits and vegetables using advanced image processing techniques. The primary objective is to develop an effective image pre-processing methodology to support machine learning models in accurately determining the quality and category of fruits and vegetables. Our approach involves converting images to the HSV color space, applying thresholding, and utilizing morphological operations such as closing and dilation. We utilized two models for our classification tasks: a modified ResNet-18 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT). The ResNet-18 model was adapted with additional dense layers for multi-label classification, predicting both the fruit's name and its freshness. Similarly, the ViT model was fine-tuned for our dataset, demonstrating superior performance in capturing intricate image features through its transformer architecture. The results indicate that our image pre-processing techniques significantly improve the classification accuracy. The ViT model achieved an impressive accuracy of 100% for fruit type classification and 97% for fruit quality assessment, outperforming the ResNet-18 model, which recorded accuracies of 98% and 94%, respectively. These findings underscore the potential of advanced image processing and ViT models in addressing food waste by enhancing the precision of freshness classification in fruits and vegetables.
